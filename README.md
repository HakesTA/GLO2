Graded Learning Opportunity #2

	Halloween, a snow fall and daylight savings time can pull a community together and renew a sense of civic purpose.   Unfortunately, the combination of a time change, cold weather and the post Halloween sugar crash can also be a time of fear, accidents and uncertainty.  Therefore, you have decided to create a web site that celebrates the fun and excitement of the current week while providing safety recommendations.  Specifically, you are being asked to provide details regarding the post-holiday blues, snowfall and getting an extra hour of sleep by creating a site that includes or demonstrates the use of CSS and XHTML or HTML5 as well as design conventions.
